# Address

**Quebec House Apartments**

**2800 Quebec St NW Apt 1137**

Washington, DC 20008

My building has entrances on Quebec St and Porter St. Quebec St has a lot of construction right now, so I suggest entering through Porter St.

I am on the 11th floor.

# Directions

## By metro

Get off at Cleveland Park station (red line). Turn right after getting off the extra long escalators. When you are on street level, walk towards the gas station behind you. Turn right and walk downhill along Porter St. My building is a large red brick building on the left and there is a large pink purple flowery "Welcome" sign.

Street parking along Porter St is free weeknights and on weekends, but street parking close to the gas station is metered. If you drive downhill along Porter St, there is a lot of free street parking. 

If you're having trouble finding street parking on Porter St, you can continue onto Porter St on the West side of Connecticut Ave and it should be easy to find street parking in the neighborhood.
